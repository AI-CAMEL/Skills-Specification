# The Open Cognitive Skills Specification

The Open Cognitive Skills (OCS) specification defines a standard, language-agnostic, and platform-agnostic language that describes how to use containerized, serverless applications to composes and executes code, machine learning models, and data.  Skills enables data scientists and developers to easily compose, pack, ship, run and scale any machine learning model and code across any design and deployment environment.

## Current Version

The 1.0.0 specification of Open Cognitive Skills is [here](https://github.com/AI-CAMEL/Skills-Specification/blob/master/versions/1.0.0.md).

## Releationship to Cognitive Agent Modeling and Execution Language (CAMEL)

The Open Cognitive Skills specification is the first of a family of specifications grouped under the [CAMEL initiative](https://camelai.org).  The CAMEL initiative defines a standard, language-agnostic, and platform-agnostic language that describes the composition and orchestration of skills, data, and machine learning models to define and exeucte a **Cognitive Agent** that is used to augment human intelligence.  CAMEL is an acronym that stands for "Cognitive Agent Modeling and Execution Language" and can be thought of as a language for programming Cognitive Agents.  The OCS specification focuses on the **Cognitive Skill** construct which is the key building block of Cognitive Agents.
